# About
Moved over from my magzine repo, this is my playground to learn about implementing iOS features & functions.
My hopes are that I can help figure some things out for other people to use in their apps & websites.

# Examples

#### Metadata

Playing with head tags/information to add/augment/remove features of iOS

+ Homescreen icons
+ splash screens
+ orientation
+ scaling

#### scrolling

creating a position: fixed element while having other parts still scroll. A real pain, but iOS 5 promises to fix it by bringing
native "position: fixed" to webkit!

+ emulate position fixed
+ scrollable divs that do not affect the page

#### Touch Inputs

console log each touch/swipe/multi-touch input as they happen

+ single touch
+ multi-touch
+ swipes
+ pinches
+ etc.
